    <p>
        You can upload your image for detection on this page.<br>
        You can see detections from other users in Gallery.
    </p>
    <form method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>
        <label>Image Input</label><br>
        <input type=file name=file accept="image/jpeg,image/jpg, image/png,image/gif"><br>
        <input type=submit value=Upload>
    </form>
    <p>
        P.S. I tried to realise detection from webcam but now it can't send your photo to server for detection, but you can save your photo and send yourself.<br>
        Sorry, I will fix it as soon as possible!
